%   abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract = { Abstract. This article introduces HODLR2D, a new hierarchical low-rank representation for a class of dense matrices arising out of \(N\) -body problems in two dimensions. Using this new hierarchical framework, we propose a new fast matrix-vector product that scales almost linearly. We apply this fast matrix-vector product to accelerate the iterative solution of large dense linear systems arising out of radial basis function interpolation and discretized integral equation. The space and computational complexity of HODLR2D matrix-vector products scale as \(\mathcal{O}(pN \log (N))\) , where \(p\) is the maximum rank of the compressed matrix subblocks. For the logarithmic kernel function, we prove that \(p \in \mathcal{O} \left (\log \left (N\right ) \log \left (\log \left (N\right ) \right ) \right )\) . We also numerically observe a similar scaling for other kernel functions in 2D. We thereby demonstrate that the storage and computational complexity of HODLR2D matrix-vector products remain tractable for large \(N\) . Additionally, we also study the parallel scalability of HODLR2D as part of this article. },

  abstract  = {In recent times, machine learning is finding many important use cases in the financial services industry. Financial datasets usually pose significant statistical challenges, and hence, traditional econometric methods fail in many practical applications. Though several approaches are suggested and being used, to predict whether a borrower would default on the loan availed, it is still an open challenge. In this work, two approaches are proposed based on LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) along with a hybrid neural network architecture to understand the context between financial transactions and loan defaults. The novelty of the proposed methods is in how they handle structured data and the associated temporal data. Further, the performance of the proposed approaches using debit card transactions and loan application information of customers to predict default is demonstrated. The experiments provided promising accuracies. Bidirectional LSTMs with a hybrid architecture achieve an accuracy of 94{\%}. Hybrid neural network architectures used in this work provide an appropriate direction for making an early warning system through online loan default prediction.Kandappan, V. A.Rekha, A. G.},
